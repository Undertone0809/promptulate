    "# Custom Tool\n",
    "Tool is a very important part of Agent. Agent can use tool to do many things, such as get data, process data, and so on. Agent has many built-in tools, but sometimes we need to customize our own tools. Now we will introduce how to custom tool in promptulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In promptulate, there are some methods to create tool for agent. Now we will introduce them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to create the most straightforward development approach for developers. To integrate a tool with the language learning model (LLM), you may follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenAI's framework:\n",
    "1. **Implement the tool's logic**: Write the code that defines what your tool does.\n",
    "2. **Declare the tool's schema**: Specify the structure and parameters of your tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Langchain:\n",
    "1. **Extend the `Tool` class**: Create a new class that inherits from `Tool`.\n",
    "2. **Implement the `_run()` method**: This method should contain the operational logic of your tool.\n",
    "3. **Define `name` and `description` attributes**: These should clearly describe your tool's purpose and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Promptulate:\n",
    "1. **Provide your function**: Simply pass your function to Promptulate.\n",
    "2. **Let Promptulate handle the rest**: Promptulate automatically takes care of the necessary configurations and integrations for your tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promptulate simplifies the process, requiring minimal effort from the developer to make a tool functional with LLM. This is an awesome attempt we made, and we hope you will enjoy it! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Define your tool\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the following method to declare your tool. The following example show how to custom a web_search tool by function declared and use tool in ToolAgent. Here we use duckduckgo as search engine."
