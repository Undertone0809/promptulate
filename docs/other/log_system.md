# Log System

When you run promptulate components, all the logs are stored in a log folder. Promptulate divides the logs by date, which means that each day will have a separate log file.

You can find the logs in the following path:

- windows: /Users/username/.zeeland/pne/logs
- linux: /home/username/.zeeland/pne/logs
