# Use cases

This section contains walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use tasks.

We hope to guide users through some official best practices to get up to speed and learn pne at a lower cost. Before doing so, please make sure you have read [quick start](get_started/quick_start.md#quick-start) and [awesome chat](use_cases/chat_usage.md)

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, try one out! While they reference building blocks that are explained in greater detail in other sections, we absolutely encourage folks to get started by going through them and picking apart the code in a real-world context.
